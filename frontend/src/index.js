          <p id="homeProject">Hello! My name is Austin Doll, I graduated from Central Michigan University in 2018 with a major in Computer Science. I have spent the last three years working at Dynatrace as both a Consultant and a Customer Solutions Engineer. During my time in these roles I have worked with just about every cloud provider that is available along with becoming certified in both Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. In the future I hope to be in a position to use my knowledge of APM software along with container orchestration to move into a cloud or platform engineering role. The wonderful thing about being in my current position is that I have been allowed to be exposed to just about every platform and technology under the sun. Coming out of college I did not have a firm idea of what I wanted to do within the Computer Science field, with so many choices it was impossible to know without giving something a shot. Over time, I found myself more drawn to infrastructure, in particular cloud infrastructure. From there it made sense to me to get familiar with containers as that seems to be the trend lately. Now, having a strong troubleshooting foundation and a firm understanding of how all of the pieces fit together I feel confident and ready to take on any challenges that may come my way.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, I enjoy Disc Golfing and riding my longboard during the summer and praying the cold away during the winters. One of the hobbies that takes up the most of my time is cooking! I love cooking just about any cuisine I can get my hands on with my current favorites being Italian and Thai style noodles. Along with all of this, I am an avid board game fanatic and absolutely love getting together with some friends and trying out something new.</p>

          <p>Initially I started working on this project to gain a bit more knowledge on how web requests work as well as GO as a language. The first steps I took here was to get it running within the commandline, this started me in a good spot so I could focus on learning the syntax of the language as well as the ins and outs of the package I was using. From there I decided to move it into the web versus running it through the commandline, I then hosted this in (at the time) Pivotal Web Services where I could access this application through the web and download the imaged in a packaged zip file. Overall I learned a bit about how webapps work, and some of the pitfalls of not pre-planning how to handle more than just a single user. </p>

          <p>
          In the code above, I assigned functions to the response and reqeust to keep track of the URLS that I had visited to avoid downloading two of the same image, which also applied to favicons and smaller images. On response I setup a function called 'save' that would store the images locally and print an exit line of 'visited' to show that the image was downloaded and a new URL would be queued to be scrapped for images.

          <p>I set off to learn how a full stack application is built and developed. I wanted to build something of my own that would give me confidence in my knowledge of how applications work as well as learning more about how tools like GitHub can be used to control how my app is versioned and built. When I started working on this project I had essentially no knowledge of JavaScript or how to connect apps from frontend to database. This project most likely will be ever evolving as I learn new technologies and improve the general layout and style of this website along with adding new projects as I bring them to competition. I also have a passion for Kubernetes and want to become a defacto expert in it, I started by getting Kubernetes Administrator certified and I am using a single node cluster to run this application. By doing this, I learned how different components can reach out to each other in a kube-manner and how microservices and applications can be efficiently ran in the cloud/containerized. If you have any questions or want to get ahold of me for an opportunity please check out my contact page and reach out however you prefer!</p>
          <p>On the right I have included my Dockerfile as an example, both the frontend and backend use a similar layout. The foundation of this project started with the goal of being able to implement a fullstack project it only made sense to start with the smallest building block I can with a Dockerfile. Simply put, this Dockerfile gathers the latest image from node, copies both of my package scripts for startup, installs NPM then starts my application. A minor improvement I could make is actually producing a production level application with npm build over npm start, but for this project a quicker startup time is helpful for the constant changing in the source code. I have pushed this file to Dockerhub and use this as a base to my Kubernetes deployment definition. Both the frontend and backend run in single pod deployments, which is not optimal for high availability but it keeps the cost down for personal projects ðŸ˜Š. From there I exposed both deployments publicly with the frontend being the IP/pod combo that you are accessing this website at. Overall, this portion of the project provided the bit of hands on from start to finish Kubernetes experience that I felt that I needed.
